# WebhookDiscordLimeSurvey
A webhook for discord from LimeSurvey.
Right now it let you choose your Webhook, Debug-Mode and affected surveys from the plugin-settings.

In the future it should also let you choose the fields and layout choose freely via the settings.
At thi point everythig is very specific to one of my Surveys and hardcoded in the plugin.
But there is no ETA when and if I tackle that.


# Installation
Download the zip from the [releases](https://github.com/IrishWolf/limesurvey_webhook/releases) page and extract to your plugins folder.
That should be under `root/upload/plugins`.


# Usage
You are free to use/change/fork this code for your own products.
